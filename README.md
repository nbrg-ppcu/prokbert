### Introduction
The ProkBERT model family is a transformer-based, encoder-only architecture based on [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert). Built on transfer learning and self-supervised methodologies, ProkBERT models capitalize on the abundant available data, demonstrating adaptability across diverse scenarios. The modelsâ€™ learned representations align with established biological understanding, shedding light on phylogenetic relationships. With the novel Local Context-Aware (LCA) tokenization, the ProkBERT family overcomes the context size limitations of traditional transformer models without sacrificing performance or the information-rich local context. In bioinformatics tasks like promoter prediction and phage identification, ProkBERT models excel. For promoter predictions, the best-performing model achieved an MCC of 0.74 for E. coli and 0.62 in mixed-species contexts. In phage identification, they all consistently outperformed tools like VirSorter2 and DeepVirFinder, registering an MCC of 0.85. Compact yet powerful, the ProkBERT models are efficient, generalizable, and swift.

### Features
- Tailored to microbes. 
- Local Context-Aware (LCA) tokenization for better genomic sequence understanding.
- Pre-trained models available for immediate use and fine-tuning.
- High performance in various bioinformatics tasks.
- Facilitation of both supervised and unsupervised learning.


## Installation

### Installing with pip

The recommended way to install ProkBERT is through pip, which will handle most dependencies automatically:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/nbrg-ppcu/prokbert.git
```

### Installing with conda
(The best is using the github codes)
ProkBERT is also available as a conda package from the Bioconda channel. To install it using conda, run:

```bash
conda install prokbert -c bioconda
```

### Using Docker
Before using the ProkBERT container with GPU support, make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python (3.10 or later)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (required if you plan to use the Docker image)
- [NVIDIA Docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) (required if you intend to use Docker with GPU support)

To pull and run the ProkBERT Docker image, use:

```bash
docker pull obalasz/prokbert
```

To run the container with GPU support, use:

```bash
docker run --gpus all -it --rm -v $(pwd):/app obalasz/prokbert python /app/finetuning.py --help
```

This command runs the ProkBERT Docker container with GPU support, mounts the current directory to the container (allowing access to your local files), and displays the help message for the `finetuning.py` script.

### Using Singularity (Apptainer)

For users who prefer Singularity (now also known as Apptainer), a Singularity (Apptainer) container definition is provided. Please refer to the official documentation for instructions on building and running Singularity containers. A prebuilt container is available on Zenodo: [https://zenodo.org/records/10659030](https://zenodo.org/records/10659030).

Building the Singularity container:

```bash
apptainer build prokbert.sif prokbert.def
```
To pull directly from Docker Hub and convert to a Singularity image file:
```bash
singularity pull prokbert.sif docker://obalasz/prokbert
```

Once you have your `.sif` file, you can run ProkBERT with the following command:
```bash
singularity run --nv prokbert.sif python /opt/prokbert/examples/finetuning.py --help
```

The `--nv` flag enables NVIDIA GPU support, assuming your system has NVIDIA drivers and CUDA installed. Remove this flag if you're running on a CPU-only system.

You can also shell into the container or execute specific commands as follows:
Shell into the container:
```bash
singularity shell --nv prokbert.sif
```

## Applications
ProkBERT has been validated in several key genomic tasks, including:
- Learning meaningful representation for seqeuences (zero-shot capibility)
- Accurate bacterial promoter prediction.
- Detailed phage sequence analysis within complex microbiome datasets.


## Quick Start
Our models and datasets are available on the [hugginface page](https://huggingface.co/neuralbioinfo). 
The models are easy to use with the [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) package.
We provide examples and descriptions as notebooks in the next chapter and some example scsripts regarging how to preprocess your sequence data and how to finetune the available models. The examples are available in the [example](https://github.com/nbrg-ppcu/prokbert/tree/main/examples) folder of this repository. 

### TLDR example
To load the model from Hugging Face:
```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("neuralbioinfo/prokbert-mini", trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("neuralbioinfo/prokbert-mini", trust_remote_code=True)

segment = "TATGTAACATAATGCGACCAATAATCGTAATGAATATGAGAAGTGTGATATTATAACATTTCATGACTACTGCAAGACTAA"

# Tokenize the input and return as PyTorch tensors
inputs = tokenizer(segment, return_tensors="pt")

# Pass the tokenized input to the model
outputs = model(**inputs)
```

cd prokbert/examples
python prokbert_seqpreprocess.py \
  --kmer 6 \
  --shift 1 \
  --fasta_file_dir ../src/prokbert/data/pretraining \
  --out ../src/prokbert/data/preprocessed/pretraining_k6s1.h5
```

Parameters:
- `--kmer`: The size of the k-mer (number of bases) to use for sequence encoding.
- `--shift`: The shift size for sliding the k-mer window across sequences.
- `--fasta_file_dir`: Directory containing your FASTA files for pretraining.
- `--out`: Output file path for the preprocessed data in HDF5 format.

#### Running the pretraining from scratch:

Use the preprocessed HDF file as input for pretraining. Execute the commands below:

```bash
python prokbert_pretrain.py \
  --kmer 6 \
  --shift 1 \
  --dataset_path ../src/prokbert/data/preprocessed/pretraining_k6s1.h5 \
  --model_name prokbert_k6s1 \
  --output_dir ./tmppretraining \
  --model_outputpath ./tmppretraining
```

Parameters:
- `--model_name`: Name for the model configuration to be used or saved.
- `--output_dir`: Directory where the training logs and temporary files will be saved.
- `--model_outputpath`: Path where the final trained model should be saved.

# ProkBERTâ€™s results
ProkBERT is a novel genomic language model family designed for microbiome studies, pretrained on extensive genomic datasets from the NCBI RefSeq database. The pretraining covered a diverse range of organisms, utilizing over 206.65 billion tokens from various genomes, encompassing bacteria, viruses, archaea, and fungi. The final dataset included 976,878 unique contigs from 17,178 assemblies, representing 3,882 distinct genera. Detailed methodology and tokenization strategies are elaborated in our [paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1331233/full).

## Genomic features
ProkBERT's embeddings provide insights into genomic structures and relationships, distinguishing between different genomic elements. The models showcase strong generalization abilities, aligning with established biological principles.

## Promoter identification
ProkBERT models have been applied to identify bacterial promoters, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing tools.

![Promoter prediction performance metrics](assets/Figure6_prom_res.png)
*Figure 2: Performance metrics of ProkBERT in promoter prediction.*

ProkBERT models demonstrated high performance with an impressive accuracy and MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient) of 0.87 and 0.74, outperforming other established tools such as CNNProm and iPro70-FMWin. This highlights ProkBERT's effectiveness in correctly identifying both promoters and non-promoters, with consistent results across various model variants. The evaluation also included a comparative analysis with newer tools like Promotech and iPromoter-BnCNN.

## Phage prediction
In phage sequence analysis, ProkBERT outperforms traditional methods, proving its efficacy in identifying phage sequences within complex genomic data.

*Figure 3: Comparative analysis showcasing ProkBERT's performance in phage prediction.*

Our evaluations demonstrate the performance of ProkBERT in classifying phage sequences. It achieves high sensitivity and specificity even in challenging cases where available sequence information is limited. However, this exercise also highlights an inherent limitation of ProkBERT, the restricted context window size. 
In comparative benchmarks with varying short sequence lengths, ProkBERT consistently surpassed established tools like VirSorter2 and DeepVirFinder
