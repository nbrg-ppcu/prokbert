    "# Training Helper Utilities\n",
    "To ease the process of training and evaluation multiple models, we have implemented two helper classes `TrainingHelperM` and `TrainingHelperD`, alongside a few helper functions like `get_finetuned_model_name`. These tools help us keep a tidy and safe code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `TrainingHelperM`\n",
    "This class stores metadata regarding the model we are training. Its attributes are the following:\n",
    "- `base_model_name`: This is only the name of the model without prefixes.\n",
    "- `batch_size`: Training batch size. This is auto inferred for known model (see below at `__init__()`).\n",
    "- `dataset_name`: Name of teh training dataset.\n",
    "- `epochs`: Number of training epochs.\n",
    "- `eval_split_name`: Name of the evaluation split of the dataset. Auto generated based on sequence length.\n",
    "- `gradient_accumulation_steps`: Gradient accumulation steps.\n",
    "- `huggingface_model_name`: This is the Hugging Face identifier of the base model we are using.\n",
    "- `huggingface_prefix`: The prefix string. Name of the developer team.\n",
    "- `learning_rate`: Learning rate used to train the model.\n",
    "- `seq_len`: Max length of the training sequences.\n",
    "- `separator`: Small string used to separate fields in the finetuned name.\n",
    "- `task`: Training task name.\n",
    "- `test_split_name`: Name of the testing split of the dataset. Auto generated too.\n",
    "- `train_split_name`: Name of the training split of the dataset. Auto generated too.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods:\n",
    "`TrainingHelperM` has a few methods to further help the programmer:\n",
    "- `from_json(path)`: Loads the model from a JSON file (more below).\n",
    "- `get_default_model()`: This method returns a Hugging Face AutoModelForSequenceClassification instantiated from the name stored in the helper.\n",
    "- `get_finetuned_model_name`: Returns the finetuned model name string.\n",
    "- `get_tokenizer()`: Returns the matching tokenizer to the model.\n",
    "- `get_tokenizer_function()`: Returns a tokenizer function which can be used by `dataset.map()` for pre-tokenization and other tasks.\n",
    "- `initialize_from_environment()`: Instantiates the model helper from environmental variables (more below).\n",
    "- `initialize_from_finetuned_name(name)`: Instantiates the model helper from a finetuned name (more below).\n",
    "- `to_json(path)`: The helper can save its metadata to a JSON file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization of the class\n",
    "There are four ways to initialize a `TrainingHelperM` class. First off we can do so by calling it's `__init__()` method. Secondly we can use the `initialize_from_environment` class method, to pull the metadata from environment variables. This is extremely helpful for SLURM array jobs, as one can start up a wide range of model trainings from a single launch script. Thirdly we can initialize the model from a JSON file created by the `to_json` method. Lastly we can use the `parse_model_helper_from_finetuned_name` factory function. This one takes a pretrained model name, created by the `get_finetuned_model_name(TrainingHelperD, TrainingHelperM)` function and returns with a `TrainingHelperM` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `__init__(**kwargs)` method takes the following arguments:\n",
    "  - huggingface_model_name: (str) Required.\n",
    "  - epochs: (int) Optional. Defaults to 1.0\n",
    "  - learning_rate (float) optional. Defaults to 0.001.\n",
    "  - seq_len (int) Optional. Defaults to 512.\n",
    "  - batch_size (int) Optional. If not given it's inferred for known models, otherwise an error is thrown.\n",
    "  - gradient_accumulation_steps (int) Optional. If not given it's inferred for known models, otherwise an error is thrown.\n",
    "  Since many of the parameters are default or auto inferred those values might not be correct in every case! It is better practice to pass all known information to the `__init__` !\n",
    "\n",
    "- `initialize_from_environment()`: This is a class method factory function. It looks for the following environmental variables:\n",
    "  - `MODEL_NAME`: The full Hugging Face name of the model.\n",
    "  - `LEARNING_RATE`: The learning rate.\n",
    "  - `LS`: The maximal sequence length for the given training. (The model itself might be able to handle more!)\n",
    "  - `NUM_TRAIN_EPOCHS`: Number of training epochs.\n",
    "- `from_json(path)`: This class method loads the class from a JSON file.\n",
    "- `parse_model_helper_from_finetuned_name(name)`: Not recommended, as  it's unsafe. It only works for known models, as batch size and gradient accumulation steps are not part of the finetuned name, so they have to be auto inferred.\n"
